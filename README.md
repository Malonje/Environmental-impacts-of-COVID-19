# Studying the Environmental Impact of COVID-19 using geospatial analysis and satellite imagery

The world around us changed due to the rare disaster Corona Virus. The pandemic has resulted in a tragically large number of human lives being lost. As the countries already implemented necessary quarantine and social distancing practices preventing pandemics, the whole world was put in a great lockdown. Changes came into our life due to the lockdown already commenced impacting our environment in myriad ways. Both the positive and negative indirect effects of Covid-19 are reflected on the environment and the climate, presented in this project by using daily Earth observation data NO2 measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument TROPOMI) along with monthly averaged cell phone derived mobility data from Google, I examined the environmental impacts of lockdowns in Indian peninsular region, Central Delhi; Tapi River.

## 1. Decrease in mobility during lockdown
Google mobility data is used to estimate 2020 emission change due to COVID 19 restrictions and then examine its climate impact using TROPOMI satellite. These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Following graph shows decrease in the mobility for central delhi region in the year 2020. This early analysis outlines how passenger mobility trends in urban environments have been impacted from the first weeks of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a complete picture of how passenger transport is being impacted. The data shows the impact due to various reasons (e.g. number of registered infections and deaths, dates and extent of curfews, lockdowns, social distancing) and influence mobility behavior.

## 2. COVID Impact on Air Quality
The Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite is a low-earth orbiting satellite developed by the ESA as part of the Copernicus Programme. NO2 is one of many byproducts of industrial processes that are considered hazardous to the health of humans and the environment (EPA, 2015). From the NO2 trends observed by TROPOMI over Indian Peninsula (given in the images below), it can be seen that there was a reduction in the monthly average total tropospheric column NO2 after lockdown, and the reduction continued through April. More than half of the signal was due to the lockdown, with only the highest concentrations of NO2 (due to industrial activity) remaining near the orissa region, where most of
the refinery and industrial capability is located. Even during the lockdown, it would be expected that there would be some industrial activity to support essential services. The trend in NO2 is correlated to the mobility pattern observed during the lockdown which is shown in the Fig 1.

The following images shows the decrease in the NO2 concentrations over Indian peninsula.

## 3. Water quality during lockdown
Water and air pollution remained a major concern in the last few decades as these were gradually deteriorating in many spheres including the hydrosphere and atmosphere. As the nation-wide lockdown period in India completed more than two months, these images help us understand the short-term environmental changes. Using remote sensing data, it is displayed the improvements in ambient water quality in terms of decreased chlorophyll-a levels for a section of the Tapi River in the Gujrat region of India. Tapi River was chosen as our study area to assess its water quality. Tapi River is one of the longest
rivers of Western India. Thus, the closure of anthropogenic and industrial activities has resulted in the decline of pollutants concentration in the Tapi River. The upsurge in Chlorophyll-a concentration observed  may be supported by the fact that the natural river sedimentation can also alter the those levels in water bodies. The flow of sediments is governed by many factors such as precipitation, water and soil conservation projects, construction of reservoirs, carbonate weathering, dilution, etc. Following are the images for water quality of Tapi river in state

### CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 is a severe threat to human life and more than 500,000 deaths have been reported worldwide. However, with the complete restrictions on economic, social, educational, religious, and all other activities, the lockdown turned into a blessing. The changes pre and during lockdown are very significant to understand the short-term, as well as the long-term effect of anthropogenic activities on the hydrosphere. An average decrease of cholorphyll-a (NDCI) concentrations during lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period albeit the domestic wastewater continues to drain into the Tapi River and which eventually shows the degree to which the industrial sewage discharge and other outdoor activities are deteriorating the hydrosphere and severely polluting the river water. The effect of lockdown is also clear on the air quality, as all the main parameters (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) decreased to a noticeable extent from the pre-lockdown period and NO2 concentrations are found to be minimum in last three years. However all these human activities will resume sooner or later, and since the Tapi River is surrounded by dense urban population, the pollutants may ultimately start deteriorating the water and air quality again and the improvement reaped during lockdown wonâ€™t continue for long.
